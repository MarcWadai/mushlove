To further complicate the issue, the same species can have two different names depending on which of these states it is in.

Each chromosome can further be defined as an assemblage of many short DNA segments known as genes, which also vary in size. In Basidiomycetes, there are two genes that determine mating, each of which are located on separate chromosomes at known positions: locus A and locus B.\nIn order for two hyphae to mate, the gene sequence at each ofthese loci must be different. Most species have at least two possible sequence options, or alleles, for each locus, though some have many more. To create genetic variation in each spore, these alleles get shuffled around during the meiosis that occurs in the basidia just before spore development. Spores that have a large array of allele diversity have a greater ability to mate with other spores, effectively increasing the adaptive capacity of the fungus by providing a spore with more "options" wherever it lands. The Split Gill Fungus has more than 300 alleles at the A locus and more than 90 at the B locus, a diversity that provides for 23,328 different combinations of A and B alleles, or over 23,000 different mating types!
