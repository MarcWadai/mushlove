# Inoculation

The process of inoculation is one of the first step to the cultivation of mushroom. It is simply the act of introducing mycelium (liquid culture, spawn etc), spores (spores seryngues) into a substrate, agar dishes, or other seryngues. His main goal is to propagate, spread the mycelium to other compound so that we will be able myceliate even more substrate in the future.
