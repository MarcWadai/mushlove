# Fantastic fungi movie review

This documentary unveil the treasures that fungi are spreading around, without us noticing them. It is a good summury of the different techs and research that are currently going on with fungi (Materials, medicinal, environmental etc).

It shows you stunning timelaspe image and 3D imaging of mycelium, mold, lichen, mushrooms growing. 

The documentary touch a wide range of subjects. They will show you the symbioses and necessity of fungi in Nature. How they architecte and bring life to natural habitat. 

It mostly follows the famous mycologist Paul stamets who has impacted the lives of so many modern mycologist and people in general (me included). He takes us in the incredible journey with fungi. The documentary also featured well known authors (Michael Pollan, Eugenia Bones), psychiatres/scientist (Bob Jesse, Andrew weil etc) and other mycologist (Gary Lincoff etc).

From the fungi :
> We flourish everywhere inside everything
> On your first breath to your last. 

Fungi brings us wisdom of a billion years of evolution. It would be a shame to pass next to it. Community rely on cooperation, the power of goodness making mutual benefit, just like fungi, evolution is based on the community and extension of generosity. 



>We are not individuals. We are a vast network of molecules, energies, wavelength. The inner connectiveness of being is who we are. The world needs a paradigme shift in the consiousness.
> One connection at a time.
