# The seven stages of mushroom cultivation
Mushroom being entities of their own kingdom, have a lifecycle that is diffirent from what I we are used to by growing plants.
Being heterotrophs (organism that cannot produce his own food, need outside organic matter to feeed themselves, mostly by producing enzimes that will decompose those matters nd be absorbed by the hyphaes), they will need at certain point of their growing stage nutritous source of substrate, fresh air, light and humidity.

1- Media Preparation
The medias can be logs, chip branches, xopose, pasteurise or sterilise media

2- Inoculation and container Filling
It can be drilling and plugins of logs and stumps, spawning of mulch or bulk substrate

3- Spawn run
Colonization od, logs, mulch or bulk medi. If it is indoor cultivation, this is known as the incubation phase.

4- Complete Colonization

5- Iniationand Pinning
Once the media is fully colonize, the initiation of pinning can be triggered by some environmental change (humidity, fresh air, light)

6- Maturation and Harvest


7- Rest and dunk if necessary for future flush
