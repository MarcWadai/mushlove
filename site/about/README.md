# About me 👻

Hey there, my name is Marc based in Paris. I am far from being a professional mycologist or mushroom grower, but just a random passionate guy about the Fungi. So if you find any inaccurate info please feel free to contact me! 

I know internet and blogs like shroomry are there for these kind of data, but when I began to be interested by mushroom I found the informations about mushroom being quite disparate and difficult to navigate. 

Articles and cultivation cards are being made one by one, so stay tuned for more content to come in this timeline 😎


If you are somewhere around Paris or in France and want to share more specific details about cultivation in France, don't hesitate to join the discord or directly contact me at <friends@mushcommunity.org> :D
