# About me ðŸ‘»

Hey there, my name is Marc(oucou) and I hope you find this website useful. I am far from being a professional mycologist or mushroom grower, but just a random passionate guy about the Fungi. So if you find any inaccurate info please feel free to contact me! 

I know internet and blogs like shroomry are there for these kind of data, but when I began to be interested by mushroom I found the informations about mushroom being quite disparate and difficult to navigate. 

Articles and cultivation cards are being made one by one, so stay tuned for more content to come in this timeline ðŸ˜Ž

I would like through this website to help more and more people get interested in the limitless world of Fungi. Be sure to spread the spores around you <3
