# Mushroom foraging

It will be mushroom season again. Time to back in the forest and find little treasures lurking on the ground.
So what do you have to prepare for a mushroom hunting session ? Well this activity is not really expensive all you will need is :
- Good eyes 
- Small (or not) basket. It's good to have multiple basket to separate the one you have identified as comestible and the others.
- A knife
- A brush to clean the mushroom that you collected


## Some recommendations 
- Don't eat the mushroom unless you are 100% sure of it's comestibility
- When you are sure but still not reassure, cook a little bit and try just a small portion. Some toxic mushroom can have effects after a few hours ! So if you don't feel bad the next day, it should be good ! But again, if you are not sure, don't eat it !
- Mushrooms are not toxic by touch, so don't hesitate to manipulate them in order to identify them !
- There is always the debate to either you should cut at the base of the stipe or take all the mushroom. In my opinion, you should at least take one whole mushroom for identification, and you can then cut at the base for the others 


Finally, just enjoy the time in the forest ! I encourage you to know a little bit more about your local mushroom diversity and document it ! And why not try to reproduce it and cultivate your local species instead of propagating foregin strains :)
