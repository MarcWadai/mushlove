We will talk more deeply about that in the next paragraph. But studies and research have been made about the attraction of bees toward mycelium. Indeed, bees after feasting on mycelium will have an increase in their survival rate. Those research are still on early stage, so it is still not sure if the mycelium is boosting the bees’ immune system or actually fighting the viruses.

It will also work on a better sleeping cycle and cure some seasonal allergies.\nLion mane (Hericium erinaceus): Like the others it has a general restorative characteristics due to its anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and immunomodulating properties. But more importantly, one of his distinguished effects, is his reaction on the brain. It has the ability to repair and regenerate neurons, resulting in improved cognitive function\nTurkey tail mushroom (Coriolus versicolor or Trametes versicolor): This mushroom contains two unique beta-glucans (sugars that are found in the cell walls of bacteria): PSK and PSP. They have the ability to regenerate white blood cells (which are necessary to ward off infection) and stimulate the activity and creation of T-cells, macrophages, and natural killer (NK) cells, enabling the immune system to once again ward off and destroy pathogen. PSK is often used in combination in therapies to fight cancer.")])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=o.exports}}]);
