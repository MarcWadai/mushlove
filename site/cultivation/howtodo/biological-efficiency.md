    Definition and the use for a mushroom cultivator
---

Biological effeiciency (BE) is a term commonly used in the mushroom space. It's main goal is to allow you to predict the quantity of mushroom you can produce with a specific substrate and how you could improve your substrate, process, fruiting conditions etc . It is calculated using the dry input weight of the substrate against the weigth of the mushroom you cultivate at the end with this substrate.

>For exemple : 
>If you use 1 ton of straw and you harvest 1 ton of mushroom. It means > you have 100% BE. 
>If you use 1 ton of straw and you harvest 1,5 ton of mushroom. It means you have 150% BE etc etc ````

Depeding on how you process your substrate, what you put the substrate mix, what strain of mushroom you use etc you can end up with the different BE. So you should always write down what you do in order to have the best BE for your production.
