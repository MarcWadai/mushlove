    Different techniques for low tech pasteurisation
---

One of the most common pasteurisation method that you will find is by boiling your substrate in hot water (no more than 70Â°C). But this method required energy and surveillance. It is not the lowest tech that you can find. So below I will present you some other methods that don't 


## Natural fermentation 
There is not a lot of documentation and I have never tried it yet, but natural fermentation is the lowest tech that you can find. It is based on the same principles than lacto-fermentation for food. In an anaerobie area you have lactic bacteria that will develop and make the solution more acid. This process takes around 1 week, you don't need to do anything. You just need to let your substrate sit in the water (compltely covered) and wait :)

## Wood ash or Lime mixture

This method is using the pH differences in order to get rid of contaminant. By adding wood ash to your water you increase the pH (11-12) of your solution than will kill most of the undesirable bacteria. Then you just wait 24h to 48h. Get rid of the water and let your substrate drip the surplus of water for a few hours. 


People tend to say that you will have a better BE with cold pasteurisation. But in my case I never tried so I can't tell you if it's really true or not:D
