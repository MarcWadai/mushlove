    What are some of the techniques to inoculate spawn and the differents growing media

The expression popup like mushroom, which refers to the sudden burst/growth of things over small course of time, doens't f-come from nothing.
Indeed, mushsroom can be spread almost infinitly over generations and generations starting from somethings as small as spores (However, like us they needs to alternate food sources from time to time, or they might die of boredome :)

## Inoculation

The process of inoculation is one of the first step to the cultivation of mushroom. It is simply the act of introducing mycelium (liquid culture, spawn etc), spores (spores seryngues) into a substrate, agar dishes, or other seryngues. His main goal is to propagate, spread the mycelium to other compound so that we will be able myceliate even more substrate in the future.


## Grain to grain transfert
With one bottle of grain, you can propage the mycelium to dozens of other bottles. The first bottle is the first generation. After each transfert we increment the generation. We can do this process until a certain point. If you see that your mycelium is weaker, growing more slowly it is a good idea to start again from a first generation culture (either by cloning or new another species)


## Liquid culture to grains
Liquid culture are a great solution for home cultivators since they don't require as much clean environment than agar cultures. The liquid contain mostly water and a source of sugar.

## Spores print to spores seryngue to grains
Spores print can easily betaken by your fresh mushroom harvest. From them, you can create spore seryngues to inject into your spawn. The benefits of using liquid is an even propagation of the spores in the grain spawn.

## Agar to grain 
There can be different types of agar: Malt Extract Agar (MEA), Malt Yeast Agar (MYA) etc. It is just different recipes that varies the sugar sources. is the same process as the grain to grain transfert. Except here, we will cut part small part of the agar and put them in the sterilized grain.

## Tissue to agar
To clone a mushroom that you just grow, you can take a clean piece of tissue (usually a part inside the stipe of the mushroom after cutting it in half) and put it in an agar petri dishes. The mycelium will run again with the exact genotype of your previous mushroom.
