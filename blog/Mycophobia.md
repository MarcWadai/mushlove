# Mycophobia
I had always been afraid of... I will never touch that ...

We know nowadays that our culture and environment in which we grow will contribute a lot in how we see things, think and acts. We also know that some traits in our personality are consequences of thousands of years of evolution in our genotype.

Just like  snakes and spiders that have been fearful in our mind, could mushroom had this kind of evolution in human being ?

It doens't seems like a correct explanation since some human culture and civilization have been embracing mushrooms and their property fully from generations to generations. And in many of them, fungi had a sacred signification thanks to their medicinal and mind altering effects.

Mushrooms have this mystical aura around them. Mysterious, surnaturatual, spiritual, unknown are not words liked by western civilization. It is demonstrated by witch hunt (usually woman that are knowledge and mushrooms and plants for their medicinal and spiritual properties), repression of any magical or shaman like experiences and culture. But more importantly mushroom are strongly associated to death. From where they grow (dead organic matters), how they can affect crops (fungal disease and blight) to how they can bring direct death to the human (either by injecting poisonous or contract a fungal disease).

How different culture deal with death is primordial to understand their relationship with mushroom. In Eastern civilization, dominated by buddhism and the notion of eternal life through the cycle of life and Karma, spirituality plays a way bigger role in the life of those civilization. Consequently, mushrooms properties are embraced, bringing a much more mycophilia civilization. Throughout China and Japan, mushroom have been cultivated for thousands of years, many species that most Western people would have never seen but are delicacies in Asia. 

Things that we dont understand, are easily discarded, suppressed or oppressed. Women since long have been able to give life, something that men cannot. Women were always closer to life and Nature than men. They were the first mycologist and they were oppressed.

The more a civilization cut his ties to Nature, the more fear of mushroom he will have. Mushroom are an antithesis of mechanical civilization. They are wild and enigmatique, they heal, cure, kill, restore, destroy working in symbiosis with Nature.
