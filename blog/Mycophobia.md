We know nowadays that our culture and environment in which we grow will contribute a lot in how we will see things, think and acts. We also know that some traits in our personality are consequences of thousands of years of evolution in our genotype.

Just like  snakes and spiders that have been fearful in our mind since the, could mushroom had this kind of evolution in human being ?

It doens't seems like a correct explanation since some human culture and civilization have been embracing mushrooms and their property fully from generations to generations. And in many of them, fungi had a sacred signification thanks to their medicinal and mind altering effects.
